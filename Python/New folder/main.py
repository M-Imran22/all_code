response = model("Emma always dreamed of running a marathon, but she had never been a great runner. Every time she tried, she would get tired quickly and feel like giving up. People around her told her it was too difficult, that she wasn’t built for long-distance running. But deep inside, she knew she wanted to prove to herself that she could do it. One day, she made a promise to train every day, no matter how slow she started.At first, she could barely run a mile without stopping. But instead of quitting, she focused on small improvements. Each day, she ran a little farther, pushing through the pain and doubts. Rain or shine, she laced up her shoes and kept going. Months passed, and on the day of the marathon, she stood at the starting line, nervous but determined. Step by step, mile by mile, she kept moving forward, remembering all the hard work she had put in.After hours of running, Emma finally crossed the finish line. She wasn’t the fastest, but she had done what once seemed impossible. The cheers from the crowd filled her with pride, but what mattered most was the realization that she was stronger than she had ever believed. From that day on, she knew that any goal was possible with patience, effort, and the courage to never give up.")
